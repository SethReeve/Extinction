					<h3>Human Uses and Extinction</h3>
					<p>The Japanese Sea Lion was terrible to eat. The fisher-men ended up killing them and using them for blubber. They did this mainly to get the Sea Lions out of the way to fish for better food.</p>
					<p>It was considered to be entinct in 1970. its extinction was helped by the Japanese commercial harvest that ended in the 1940s.</p>
